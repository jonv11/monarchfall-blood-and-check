# Definition of Ready

## Purpose
Define when a Jira Task or Feature is ready to start.

## Scope
Applies to Tasks and Features before work begins.

A Task/Feature is **Ready to Start** when:

- ✓ **Acceptance Criteria are clear and measurable** – a reviewer can unambiguously verify completion
- ✓ **Dependencies are documented** – no hidden blockers or prerequisite work
- ✓ **Scope is clearly bounded** – work fits in planned timeframe (1-2 days for Task, 3-5 days for Feature)
- ✓ **Design is approved** – architectural decisions made; no "figure it out during implementation"
- ✓ **Necessary context is linked** – design docs, prior discussions, related issues referenced
- ✓ **No follow-up work ambiguity** – if this Task is done, the Feature is 90%+ complete

**Anti-Pattern:** "Figure it out as you go" – this means the issue isn't ready.
