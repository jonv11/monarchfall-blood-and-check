# General Naming Principles

## Purpose
State the baseline naming principles for MFBC code and documentation.

## Scope
Applies to all identifiers, comments, and documentation.

## Principles

1. **Clarity over brevity:** Names should be self-explanatory
2. **English only:** All identifiers, comments, and documentation in English
3. **Consistency:** Follow established patterns throughout the codebase
4. **Standard C# conventions:** Align with [Microsoft's C# Coding Conventions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
